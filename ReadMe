This peoject is written by ASP.NET 2.0, and uses Ajax. 
As ASP.NET 2.0 doesn't support Ajax default, you should download "ASPAJAXExtSetup.msi" first, and install it.

YOU can find more infomation about it here:http://asp.net/ajax/documentation/live/InstallingASPNETAJAX.aspx

To run it well, you must config the SQL Server connection. I choose SQL Server 2005, and the database file is in the directory "App_Data".
Open "Web.config", modify the following parameters.

	<connectionStrings>
		<add name="ConnectionString" connectionString="Data Source=XXXX;Initial Catalog=Examination;User ID=XXXX;Password=XXXX" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	</connectionStrings>
